Included in this submission is a description of the input and output files that our CAD tool will utilize. 'example.xml' is an example io file that demonstrates the data format the tool will accept. Also included is a png file containing a block diagram of the basic design of the system as we currently see it. We have yet to actually begin so parts are subject to change. Finally, we include the start of a user guide for the CAD tool.

Network completion is accomplished by using the cheapest wire type first.
