<!-- Note for remaining sections: Throughput is derived concept from latency, packetLoss,
and bandwidth. Thus if you prioritize throughput, you're implicately prioritizing those 3 metrics.
We will clarify this and possibly change the final preferences in later revisions. -->

<!-- latency, packetLoss and throughput are weights and relative to eachother.
Will be normalized by the tool. Budget is not a weight but rather a fixed max boundary-->
